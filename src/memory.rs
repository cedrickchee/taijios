//! # Memory management module
//! 
//! We want to access page tables from our kernel.
//! 
//! This module implements support for paging in our kernel, which makes it
//! possible to access the page tables that our kernel runs on.
//! 
//! It also implements:
//! - a function that traverses the page table hierarchy in order to translate
//!   virtual to physical addresses.
//! - a function to create new mappings in the page tables and to find unused
//!   memory frames for creating new page tables.
