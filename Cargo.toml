# Enable QEMU special `isa-debug-exit` device, which provides an easy way to
# exit QEMU from the guest system.
# 
# The `bootimage runner` appends the test-args to the default QEMU command for
# all test executables. For a normal `cargo run`, the arguments are ignored.
# 
# Together with the device name (`isa-debug-exit`), we pass the two parameters
# `iobase` and `iosize` that specify the I/O port through which the device can
# be reached from our kernel.
