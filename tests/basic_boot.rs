// The test might seem a bit useless right now since itâ€™s almost identical to
// one of the VGA buffer tests. However, in the future the `_start` functions of
// our `main.rs` and `lib.rs` might grow and call various initialization
// routines before running the `test_main` function, so that the two tests are
// executed in very different environments.
// 
// By testing `println` in a `basic_boot` environment without calling any
// initialization routines in `_start`, we can ensure that `println` works right
// after booting. This is important because we rely on it e.g. for printing
// panic messages.
